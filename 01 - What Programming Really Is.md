# 01 - What Programming Really Is (First Principles)

## Goal of This Lesson
Understand what programming actually means at the most basic level, so your brain stops freezing when you see a problem.

No JavaScript yet.  
No pressure.  
Only thinking.

## First Principle 1: Computers Are Extremely Stupid

A computer:
- Has no common sense
- Cannot guess
- Cannot assume
- Only does EXACTLY what you tell it

If you don’t tell the computer something,
it will NOT do it.

This is the most important rule in programming.

## Example 1: Human Thinking vs Computer Thinking

### Human Instruction
"Make a cup of tea."

A human automatically understands many steps.

### Computer Reality
A computer understands NOTHING unless you say:

1. Take a cup
2. Put cup on table
3. Add tea leaves
4. Heat water
5. Pour water into cup
6. Wait
7. Add sugar
8. Stir

👉 Programming is writing these tiny steps.

## First Principle 2: Programming Is Not About Being Smart

Many beginners think:
- "I’m bad at logic"
- "I can’t think like programmers"
- "Others get it faster"

Reality:
- Programming is a **learned skill**
- Skills feel confusing before they click
- Everyone struggles here

If you can explain something step by step in English,
you can learn programming.

---

## First Principle 3: Programs Are Just Instructions

At the lowest level, a program is:
- A list of instructions
- Executed one by one
- Exactly as written

No magic.
No creativity required yet.
Just clarity.

---

## Example 2: Counting Pushups (No Code)

English instructions:
1. Start from zero
2. Do one pushup
3. Increase count by one
4. Repeat

This is already programming thinking.

You didn’t write code,
but your brain is doing the right thing.

---

## First Principle 4: Why Beginners Feel Stuck

Your brain feels stuck because:
- Humans think in big ideas
- Computers need tiny steps
- You jump directly to code

This causes confusion and panic.

The solution:
👉 Slow down  
👉 Think smaller  
👉 Explain everything

---

## Example 3: Counter Thinking (No Code)

Wrong thinking:
"Make a counter"

Correct thinking:
- Where is the number stored?
- What number do we start with?
- When should it change?
- By how much should it change?

This is real programmer thinking.

---

## Mental Rule to Remember

> If something feels obvious, the computer still needs it explained.

Assume the computer knows NOTHING.

### Task 4
Explain:
**Locking a door**
step by step

- Walkin to the door.
- Hold the gate door with your hand.

- Insert the keys into the hole, which is in the middle of the gate.
- Rotate the keys two times.
- Pull the keys out of the door.
- Door gets locked.

### Task 5
Describe:
**Counting 5 coins on a table**
using instructions

- Start from zero.
- For each coin you see, increase the count by one.
- Final value is the total number of coins.

### Task 6
Write steps for:
**Refreshing a webpage**

- Place your first finger on the Trackpad
- Move the cursor to the top left of your screen.
- Click the refresh button.
- Webpage gets refreshed.

### Task 7
Explain:
**Adding 1 to a number**
without using math symbols

- Select the number.
- Increase the count of number by 1.
- Final value is the result.

### Task 8
Describe:
**Checking if a glass is empty**
in robot-level detail

- Selec the glass as seeing object.
- Check if there is water in the glass by seeing into it.
- If there is water in the glass, return true
- If there is absolutely no water in the glass, return false.
- If false gets returned, glass is empty.

### Task 9

## Lesson 01 Summary

- Programming = tiny instructions
- Computers have zero common sense
- Feeling confused is normal
- Thinking smaller is the key skill

You are not bad at programming.
Your brain is just learning a new way to think.
